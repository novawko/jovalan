            <li>Do not claim any of the species as yours!</li>
            <li>Do not steal someone else's Jovian design, you may be inspired by it, but you can't entirely mimic it.</li>
            <li>Do not attempt to scam anyone, especially the members of Jovalan.</li>
            <li>We are not responsible if you are scammed by a user we may not know selling the species.</li>
            <li>CBC (Character Based Character) Jovian characters are allowed. Just don't heavily reference a character that may lead to copyright issues. However, you may take very light inspiration to prevent copyright.</li>
            <li>Jovalan species based on real people are allowed, to a degree.*<br>
              <i class="small text-muted">(*Hitler is definitely not one of them. Nazi's or anything like that aren't allowed.)</i>

          </h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>You must be 13+ to join!</b> This is as per Toyhouse's rules, anyone under 13 aren’t allowed on Toyhouse.</li>
            <li><b>No Mini-Modding!</b> If you aren't aware what mini-modding is, its when a non-staff member enforces the rules of the server! We understand you're trying to help, but please do not mini-mod! If someone is breaking the rules, report them to a staff member immediately!</li>
            <li><b>Online Safety!</b> Your privacy online is important to us! Please refrain from telling anyone your personal location, your real name, your IP or sending any face reveals! Unless you're 18+ and can fully consent and are comfortable doing it, you may share your face and name, thank you!</li>
            <li><b>Respect everyone, including yourself and staff.</b> This means, please do not call each other names, tell eachother to kys/k**l yourself even if it’s in a joking manner. It would definitely help if you used tone tags, but then again, it isn’t really appropriate and can upset others. Even calling others losers in a seemingly demeaning way can be considered disrespectful. Please try to use tone tags if you’re joking, but please be mindful of what others may feel or how the person you’re saying it to can feel, even if they don’t speak up on how they feel ❤️</li>
            <li><b>Discrimination of any kind is not allowed!</b> The unjustified and harmful treatment of people of different categories, especially on the grounds of ethnicity, age, s**, or disability is not allowed and will result in an immediate ban.</li>
            <li><b>No Spamming.</b> Do not copy-paste a message multiple times, and don't spam people's PMs. If your spam message is found to be inappropriate, our staff may take action to kick you or might be banned, depending on the message's contents.</li>
            <li><b>Always credit art!</b> Please watermark your art and characters to make sure they don't get stolen.</li>
            <li><b>Swearing is allowed, to a degree.</b> Please be appropiate about it.</li>
            <li><b>Trigger Warnings.</b> Please give trigger warnings for triggering topics/posts/gifs/art and make sure to spoiler it! As we don't want to trigger anyone or cause seizures. Some people may be sensitive to bright and flashing lights!</li>
            <li><b>Z**p*ilia and P**op*illia, anything that may put animals and or minors in compromising (s**ual) situations are not allowed here!</b> If something like that is posted here it will result in a instant ban and a report.</li>
            <li><b>Don't post NSFW in the group!</b> You may have NSFW in your characters gallery, but the art must be set as NSFW so minors don't see it!</li>
